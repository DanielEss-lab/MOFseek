bond lengths:

M6_node : 2.0-2.45 (.66 contributed from O, so 1.79 at most from metal)
CO2_1: close is 1.77 (1.01 contributed from *), far is 2.395 from O (1.74 from *)and 2.821 from C
H2O_1: 2.336 (pyramidal, 2.807 away from Hydrogen) and H2O_2: 2.336 (all in one plane, 2.975 away from H) (1.68 from *)

Carbon or hydrogen: 1.1 ish
anything: 1.8
known metal: 1.8


# = 1.1 (Carbon or Hydrogen only)
* = 1.9 (metal or nonmetal)
% = 2.4 (only matches metals)
